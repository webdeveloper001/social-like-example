                        the Promotor will continue receiving commission. There is no limit on how much money a promotor can

                    <p class="text-left">Consider the example of a Rank-X promoter that closes one business per month and receives $30 commission
                        per business (actual commission might vary). Promoter sign ups come with a 60 days free trial for
                        that business. After free trial expires, and business start paying subscription, Rank-X promoter
                        will get paid commission for that account as shown in the table below.
