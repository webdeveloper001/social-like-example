<p class="text-left">All payments to promotors are strictly based on commissions. Rank-X offers lasting commissions on all accounts that a Rank-X promotor closes. As long as 
    the account that the promoter closed are active, the Promotor will continue receiving commission. There is no limit on how much
    money a promotor can make.
</p>
<p class="text-left">Consider the example of a Rank-X promoter that closes one business per month and receives $30 commission per business 
    (actual commission might vary). Promoter sign ups come with a 60 days free trial for that business. After free trial expires, and 
    business start paying subscription, Rank-X promoter will get paid commission for that account as shown in the table below.
